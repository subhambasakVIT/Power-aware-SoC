# Power-aware-SoC-
This project aims to design a complete System-on-Chip (SoC) featuring a custom 16-bit RISC processor with advanced power management capabilities. The system implements Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), power gating, and adaptive clock control to optimize power consumption based on workload demands.
